# Recognising Quick, Draw! Sketches with Deep Learning

**Introduction:**  
Sketch recognition is a difficult task in computer vision due to the abstract and messy nature of human-drawn images.  
This project explores how deep learning models can classify quick doodles from Googleâ€™s [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) dataset.  
We trained and compared five models â€” CNN, LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet18, and ConvNeXt â€” to recognise hand-drawn sketches of **apple**, **car**, **cat**, **dog**, and **flower**.  
Input images were originally 28Ã—28 grayscale and resized to 128Ã—128 RGB for compatibility with deeper architectures.

**Dataset:**  
This project uses a 5-class subset of Googleâ€™s open-source [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) dataset, which contains over 50 million hand-drawn sketches collected from an online game where users had 20 seconds to draw an object. Each sketch is a 28Ã—28 grayscale image representing a single category.

**For this study:**  
_ **Selected classes**: `apple`, `car`, `cat`, `dog`, `flower`  
_ **Samples per class**: 600  
_ **Total images**: 3,000  
_ **Images were**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normalised to the [0â€“1] range    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converted to RGB  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resized to 128Ã—128 to support deeper models like AlexNet, ResNet, and ConvNeXt
    
_ **Labels encoded** as integers (e.g., `apple = 0`, `car = 1`, etc.)  
_ **Data Splits**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80% for training  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% for validation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, 20% was reused as a test set   

_ **Preprocessing & Augmentation**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour jitter (brightness, contrast, saturation)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random horizontal flip  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random resized crop to 128Ã—128  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normalisation using ImageNet mean and std
    
_ **Validation/Test set transformations:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resize to 128Ã—128  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normalisation only

**Methodology:**  
This project evaluates five deep learning models for classifying hand-drawn sketches. All input images were resized to **128Ã—128 RGB** to meet the input requirements of deeper models. Each model outputs class probabilities for: `apple`, `car`, `cat`, `dog`, and `flower`.  
  
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
A simple CNN with two convolutional layers, ReLU activations, pooling layers, and fully connected output. It serves as a fast and lightweight baseline model.

2. LeNet  
LeNet is an early CNN architecture adapted here for 128Ã—128 RGB images. It uses average pooling and three fully connected layers. Performs well on simple data, but lacks depth.

3. AlexNet  
A deeper CNN pretrained on ImageNet with five convolutional and three dense layers. Fine-tuned by replacing the final layer for 5-class classification.
