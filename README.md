# üñçÔ∏è Recognising Quick, Draw! Sketches with Deep Learning

**Introduction**

Sketch recognition is a difficult task in computer vision due to the abstract and messy nature of human-drawn images.  
This project explores how deep learning models can classify quick doodles from Google‚Äôs [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) dataset.

We trained and compared five models ‚Äî CNN, LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet18, and ConvNeXt ‚Äî to recognise hand-drawn sketches of **apple**, **car**, **cat**, **dog**, and **flower**.  
Input images were originally 28√ó28 grayscale and resized to 128√ó128 RGB for compatibility with deeper architectures.
